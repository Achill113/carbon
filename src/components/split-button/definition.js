  designerNotes: `
* Offers one more important action to the user, with some related actions also quickly accessible, but without taking up valuable space by showing them all separately.
* But, users may not always discover the related items, and could miss out.
* Only use this component for buttons that are very closely related (e.g. Save, Save and Email, Save and Print, Save and New).
* Only use this component if one option is more generic or important than the others.

* __Taking a single positive or negative action?__ Try Button.
* __Range of buttons all of the same importance?__ Try Multi Action Button.
* __Choosing one option from a highly visible range?__ Try Button Toggle.
