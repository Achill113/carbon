  description: `Several buttons that don't need to be seen all the time - buttons are of equal importance, and related to each other. - one option is more important than the others, but theyâ€™re all related.`,
  designerNotes: `
* Offers one more important action to the user, with some related actions also quickly accessible, but without taking up valuable space by showing them all separately.
* But, users may not always discover the related items, and could miss out.
* Useful to show about 5 options or less.
* Only use this component for buttons that are very closely related (e.g. Save, Save and Email, Save and Print, Save and New).
* Only use this component if one option is more generic or important than the others.
