  designerNotes: `
* Offers related actions to the user, but without taking up valuable space by showing them separately.
* But, users may not always discover them, and could miss out.
* Only use this component for commands that are related (e.g. Export PDF, Export CSV).
* Donâ€™t use this component if one option is more generic or important than the others.
* Carbon has a Transparent configuration, with subtle visual style, which could be useful to present less important or infrequently used options to the user, without calling attention to them.

* __Performing a single action?__ Try Button.
* __Range of buttons where one is more important?__ Try Split Button.
* __Choosing one option from a highly visible range?__ Try Button Toggle.
