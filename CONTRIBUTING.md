## Reporting Issues/Bugs

The [issue tracker](https://github.com/sage/carbon/issues) is the preferred area to report any bugs or issues with the codebase. Once an issue is submitted, it will be reviewed and handled accordingly.

When reporting an issue, please provide as much information and context as possible allowing a developer to replicate and understand the problem. Also ensure you record the version of Carbon you are using, as well as any console or error logs.

## Requesting Features

* It is a passing build.
* The code is fully tested and has full coverage.
* The code follows our coding guidelines (TBC).
